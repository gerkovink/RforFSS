# Preparing your machine for the course

---

Dear all, 

These steps will prep your machine for my course. 

If you run into trouble, please drop me a line. 

All the best,  

[*Gerko Vink*](https://www.gerkovink.com)

## **System requirements**

You will need a laptop or desktop computer with full write access and administrator rights to the machine. We will explore programming and compiling in these exercises. This means that you need full access to your machine. Some corporate laptops (including Dutch university laptops) come with limited access for their users. I therefore advice you to bring a personal laptop computer, if you have one. 

---

## **1. Install `R`**
`R` can be obtained [here](https://cran.r-project.org). We won't use `R` directly in the course, but rather call `R` through `RStudio`. Therefore it needs to be installed. 

---

## **2. Install `RStudio` Desktop**

Rstudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It can be obtained as stand-alone software [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). The free and open source `RStudio Desktop` version is sufficient.

---

## **3. Start RStudio and install the following packages. **

Execute the following lines of code in the console window:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "tidyverse", "magrittr", "knitr", 
                   "rmarkdown", "plotly", "ggplot2", "shiny", 
                   "devtools", "car", "MASS", "mice", "miceadds"), 
                 dependencies = TRUE)
```

If you are not sure where to execute code, use the following figure to identify the console:

<center>
  <img src="console.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" width = 70%>
</center>

Just copy and paste the installation command and press the return key. When asked 

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
Do you want to install from sources the package which needs 
compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)
```

type `Yes` in the console and press the return key. 

---

## **What if these steps do not work for me?**
If all fails and you have insufficient rights to your machine, the following web-based service will offer a solution. 

1. Open a free account on [rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud). You can run your own cloud-based `RStudio` environment there. 

Naturally, you will need internet access for these services to be accessed.
