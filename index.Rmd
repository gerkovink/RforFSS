#### Preparing your machine for the course
We use `R`, `RStudio` and a variety of packages in this course. You can find a detailed guide to install the necessary software on your own laptop in [this guide](How_to_prepare.html)

If you experience terribly slow interactions with `R` on your `UU laptop`, please follow the guide [`Install R on UU laptop`](https://gist.github.com/vankesteren/f2e198aa5ab4f6262b21a3d13bbea0b5) to properly install and configure `R`. With thanks to [Erik-Jan van Kesteren](https://erikjanvankesteren.nl).
